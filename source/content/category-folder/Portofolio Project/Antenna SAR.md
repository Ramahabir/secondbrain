Perfect — let’s build you a **student-friendly VHF J-pole**: cheap, portable, and no need for exotic materials. This will be tuned around **155 MHz** (the middle of 136–174 MHz band, so you’ll cover SAR HT frequencies just fine).

# 📡 VHF J-Pole Antenna (155 MHz)

### 🎯 Target specs

- Frequency: **155 MHz**
    
- Bandwidth: covers ~136–174 MHz (with VSWR < 2 if tuned right)
    
- Gain: ~3 dBi (better than stock duck)
    
- Length: about **1.5 m tall**

## 🛠️ Materials (budget/student-friendly)

- **Copper wire** (2–3 mm diameter, ~2 m long) → common electrical wire works.
    
- **PVC pipe** (1.5 m long, ~½ inch diameter) → as the antenna “mast” and support.
    
- **50 Ω coax** (RG-58 is cheap, ~2–3 m length for portable use).
    
- **SMA/BNC connector** → to match your HT (depends on model).
    
- Electrical tape, zip ties, or hot glue → to mount wire to PVC.
    
- Soldering iron + solder (for connecting coax).
    

💡 Total cost: a few dollars if you recycle some parts.

## 📏 Dimensions (cut lengths)

Using formulas:

- **¼λ stub leg (short side):** 48.4 cm
    
- **½λ radiator (long side):** 96.8 cm
    
- **Bottom shorting bar:** keep **~2.5 cm** between stub and radiator bottoms (shorted together with wire).
    
- **Feed point:** connect coax **~5–10 cm up from the shorted bottom** (this is the “sweet spot” — you’ll slide/test for lowest VSWR).
    

So your antenna looks like a “J”: one long leg (radiator) and one shorter leg (matching stub).

## 🔧 Assembly Steps

1. **Cut the copper wire**:
    
    - One piece = 97 cm (radiator).
        
    - One piece = 48.5 cm (stub).
        
2. **Mount on PVC pipe**:
    
    - Tape or zip-tie both wires vertically on the pipe, spaced ~2.5 cm apart.
        
    - Join the bottoms with a small copper jumper (the “J” base).
        
3. **Connect coax feedline**:
    
    - Strip coax end: inner conductor to radiator, shield to stub.
        
    - Solder at ~7 cm above bottom (adjust later if VSWR is high).
        
    - Use electrical tape/zip tie for strain relief.
        
4. **Waterproof & reinforce**:
    
    - Cover solder joints with hot glue/epoxy.
        
    - Heat-shrink tubing if available.
        
5. **Mount and test**:
    
    - Hang it vertically (tree branch, pole, tent mast).
        
    - Use SWR meter or antenna analyzer to test → slide feed point up/down until <2:1 SWR.

## 📦 Portability Tips

- Use flexible **stranded copper wire** → easier to roll.
    
- Instead of PVC pipe, you can just hang the antenna wire “dangling” vertically from paracord.
    
- For backpacking: coil it up, tie with Velcro, and you’re good.

✅ Result:  
A lightweight, cheap J-pole you can build in an afternoon. Gain will feel noticeably better than HT stock antenna, especially when mounted higher.

Do you want me to also calculate **scaled dimensions for UHF (435 MHz)** so you can build a second one, or do you want to keep it strictly VHF for now?
